	<h2>Introduction	  </h2>
	<p>We know that the speed of shunt motor is given by.</p>
	<p><img src="images/Image_001.JPG" style="width:145px;height:66px" alt=""/><br>
	  Where, Va is the voltage applied across the armature and φ is the flux per pole and is proportional to the field current If.. As explained earlier, armature current Ia is decided by the mechanical load present on the shaft. Therefore, by varying Va and If we can vary n. For fixed supply voltage and the motor connected as shunt we can vary Va by controlling an external resistance connected in series with the armature. If of course can be varied by controlling external field resistance Rf connected with the field circuit. Thus for .shunt motor we have essentially two methods for controlling speed, namely by:<br>
	  1.	Varying armature resistance.<br>
	  2.	Varying field resistance.<br>
	</p>
	<h2>Speed control by varying armature resistance</h2>
	<p>In this method a variable series resistor Rext is put in the armature circuit. In this case the field is directly connected across the supply and therefore the flux ɸ is not affected by variation of Rext. in this case the current and hence the flux are affected by the variation of the armature</p>
	<p>circuit resistance. The voltage drop in Rext reduces the voltage applied  to the armature and therefore the speed is reduces.<br>
The  slope of the <em>n </em>vs. <em>I</em><em>a</em>or <em>n </em>vs. <em>T</em><em>e </em>characteristic can be modified by deliberately connecting external resistance <em>r</em><em>ext </em>in the armature  circuit. One can get a family of speed vs. armature  curves for various values of <em>r</em><em>ext</em>. From these characteristic it can be explained how speed control  is achieved. Let us assume that the load torque <em>T</em><em>L </em>is constant and field current is also kept constant. Therefore, since steady  state operation demands <em>T</em><em>e </em>= <em>T</em><em>L</em>, <em>T</em><em>e </em>= <em>k</em>φ too will  remain constant; which means <em>I</em><em>a</em>will not change. Suppose <em>r</em><em>ext </em>= 0, then at rated load torque,  operating point will be at C and motor speed will be <em>n</em>. If additional resistance <em>r</em><em>ext</em>1 is introduced in the armature circuit,  new steady state operating speed will be <em>n</em>1 corresponding to the operating point  D.<br>
In  this way one can get a speed of <em>n</em>2 corresponding to the operating point E, when <em>r</em><em>ext</em>2 is introduced in the armature  circuit. This same load torque is supplied at various speed. Variation of the speed is smooth and speed will decrease smoothly  if <em>r</em><em>ext </em>is increased. Obviously, this method is suitable  for controlling speed below the <em>base </em>speed and for supplying  constant rated load torque  which ensures rated armature current always.  Although, this method provides smooth wide  range speed control (from base speed down to zero speed), has a serious draw back since energy loss takes place in the external resistance <em>r</em><em>ext </em>reducing the efficiency of the motor.

    <h2>Speed control by varying field current</h2>
    <p>In this method field circuit resistance is varied to control the speed of a d.c shunt motor. Let us rewrite .the basic equation  to understand the method.    </p>
    <p><img src="images/Image_001.JPG" style="width:145px;height:66px" alt=""/></p>
    <p>If we vary <em>I f</em>, flux φ will change, hence speed will vary. To change <em>If </em>an
external resistance is connected in series with the field windings. The resistance  is called the shunt field regulator .the field coil produces rated flux when no external resistance  is connected and rated voltage is applied across field   coil. It  should be understood that we can   only decrease  flux from its rated value by adding  external resistance. Thus the speed of the motor will rise as we decrease the field current and speed control above the <em>base </em>speed will be achieved.  Speed versus armature current characteristic is shown.</p>
